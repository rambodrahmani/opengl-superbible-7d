# OpenGL Superbible - 7th Edition Library

This subsection contains the library is used through the chapters of this repo. This library helps us avoid repeating the same code for each tutorial and provides a framework to work within.

This framework was not written aiming to perfection and following all OOP criteria. It might therefore contain architectural mistakes and I therefore advise you against using it for real projects.
