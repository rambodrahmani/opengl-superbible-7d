 *           The initial application isnâ€™t particularly interesting, as all it does
 *           is fill the window with a solid red color. You will notice that our
 *           render() function takes a single parameter currentTime. This contains
 *           the number of seconds since the application was started, and we can
 *           use it to create a simple animation. In this case, we can use it to
 *           change the color that we use to clear the window.

/**
 * Buffer Objects are OpenGL Objects that store an array of unformatted memory
 * allocated by the OpenGL context (AKA the GPU). These can be used to store
 * vertex data, pixel data retrieved from images or the framebuffer, and a
 * variety of other things.
 *
 * Buffer objects are general purpose memory storage blocks allocated by OpenGL.
 * They are intended to be used in a great many ways. To give the implementation
 * great flexibility in exactly what a particular buffer object's data store will
 * be, so as to better optimize performance, the user is required to give usage
 * hints. These provide a general description as to how exactly the user will be
 * using the buffer object.
 *
 * A buffer object's storage can be cleared, in part or in full, to a specific value.
 *
 * If buffer is GL_COLOR, a particular draw buffer GL_DRAW_BUFFERi is specified
 * by passing i as drawbuffer, and value points to a four-element vector specifying
 * the R, G, B and A color to clear that draw buffer to. If the value of
 * GL_DRAW_BUFFERi is GL_NONE, the command has no effect. Otherwise, the value of
 * GL_DRAW_BUFFERi identifies one or more color buffers, each of which is cleared
 * to the same value. Clamping and type conversion for fixed-point color buffers
 * are performed in the same fashion as for glClearColor. The *fv, *iv and *uiv
 * forms of these commands should be used to clear fixed- and floating-point,
 * signed integer, and unsigned integer color buffers respectively.
