/*
 * Matching interface blocks by block name but allowing block instances to have
 * different names in each shader stage serves two important purposes. First, it
 * allows the name byw hich you refer to the block to be different in each stage,
 * thereby avoiding confusing things such as having to use vs_out in a fragment
 * shader. Second, it allows interfaces to go from being single items to arrays
 * when crossing between certain shader stages, such as the vertex and tessellation
 * or geometry shader stages, as we will see in a short while. Note that interface
 * blocks are only for moving data from shader stage to shader stage â€” you can't
 * use them to group together inputs to the vertex shader or outputs from the
 * fragment shader.
